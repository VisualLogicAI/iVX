# iVX - Visual Programming for Everyone

Welcome to the iVX project! iVX is a versatile graphical programming language with an integrated development environment (IDE) designed for component-based development. This repository includes various applications generated by iVX, along with their complete source code for both front-end and back-end, intended for educational purposes.

## What is iVX?

iVX is a versatile graphical programming language accompanied by a comprehensive Integrated Development Environment (IDE). At its core, iVX embodies the philosophy of "Component-Based Programming," where various components are interconnected through "Graphical Logic Orchestration" to form the complete logic of an application. This setup allows for the generation of full front-end and back-end code through the compiler/interpreter, which can be compiled independently. Given a rich library of components, this approach ensures that the entire application can be developed "code-free," while still allowing the generation of code in the "specified language/framework." Depending on user needs, users can choose to use "code" or "SDK" during development, making this highly flexible for both "non-coding learners" and "programmers with coding knowledge."

iVX can generate front-end code in Vue or React frameworks and back-end code in the Java SpringBoot framework.

## Features

- **Component-Based Development**: Develop front-end (Vue/React) and back-end (Java SpringBoot) applications using a rich library of components.
- **Graphical Logic Orchestration**: Easily connect components through graphical interfaces to form complete application logic.
- **Flexibility**: Embed custom code, upload SDKs, use handwritten SQL, CSS, HTML, and import various front-end libraries.
- **User-Friendly IDE**: Intuitive panels for components, properties, objects, events, and data flow.

## Structure of the iVX IDE

The iVX IDE includes the following panels:

- **Component Panel**
- **Properties Panel**
- **Object Tree Panel**
- **Event Panel**
- **Data Flow Panel**
- **Navigation Bar**
- **Menu Bar**
- **Stage Configuration Bar**
- **Logic Component Bar**

All added components are instantiated as objects in the Object Tree Panel. For example, pages and containers within pages, and elements within containers. Any component is designed as an object, including "Attributes," "Trigger Conditions," and "Methods/Functions." In the Object Tree, any object can have an "Event" component attached, which opens an "Event Panel" upon clicking. This panel contains "Condition Blocks," "Action Blocks," and "Loop Blocks." By combining these blocks, you can achieve Turing-complete logic expressions, typically based on triggered logic, such as an operation occurring on object A (trigger condition) leading to function execution on object B, where B may include A. The "Event Panel" allows the addition of multi-layer "Condition Blocks," "Action Blocks," and "Loop Blocks," offering flexibility akin to code but without syntax.

Another panel-based component is the "Data Flow" component, which pairs with a "Data Flow Panel." This panel includes:

- **Start Nodes**
- **End Nodes**
- **Object Nodes**
- **Function Nodes**
- **Condition Nodes**
- **Loop Nodes**
- **Event Nodes** (internal to the data flow panel)

The entire data flow diagram is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), with data flowing between nodes. The output of one node (output data) is the input of the next connected node (input data). This process is similar to functional programming, where the output of one function serves as the input for the next.

## iVX Components

iVX offers a vast array of components (1000+):

### Front-End Components

- Various visual components (buttons, images, videos, etc.)
- Container components
- Variable components
- Communication components (API, Socket, MQTT, etc.)
- Canvas components
- Third-party interfaces
- AI front-end components

### Back-End Components

- Standard components encapsulating cloud computing products
- Various databases
- MQ
- Redis
- Middleware
- Timing services
- Third-party interfaces
- AI model back-end components

## Component-Based Programming in iVX IDE

The iVX IDE adopts the "Component-Based Programming" design philosophy. Compared to "Code-Based Programming," it operates at a higher dimension, effectively isolating code, helping non-coders quickly learn programming. Each component in iVX implements object-oriented encapsulation, including "Trigger Conditions," "Attributes," and "Functions." This allows the combination of event panels and component objects to build and express complete application logic.

iVX is user-friendly for developers, supporting direct embedding of front-end and back-end code, uploading of Java/Python/Node.js/Android SDKs, handwritten SQL, CSS, HTML code, uploading npm packages, and importing various front-end libraries such as ElementUI.

## Advantages of iVX

iVX is easier to learn, faster to develop, and more convenient to maintain compared to advanced languages, while also ensuring high code quality.

## Getting Started

To get started with iVX, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ivx-project.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to a Project Folder**
    ```bash
    cd ivx-project/project-folder
    ```
3. **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4. **Run the Project**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Directory Structure


Each project folder contains:

- `frontend/`: Front-end source code (Vue/React).
- `backend/`: Back-end source code (Java SpringBoot).
- `README.md`: Specific instructions for the project.
